    let md=`# TOS: Tweets On Screen

## The Aim
To build a system to curate and show tweets which is easy to deploy and customize.

## The Solution
TOS is a turnkey solution for advertisers to curate and show tweets. It is an open source for any agency to download, deploy and customize. There are 3 components.

### Curation (Chrome Extension)
The extension is used to shortlist tweets. It adds a "shortlist button" for each tweet in twitter.com. That button sends tweet for final moderation, the approval panel.

[Download Chrome Extension](https://dooh-on-fire.web.app/tweets-curation-extension.zip)([How to install](#howtoinstallunpackedchromeextension)) | [Login Credentials](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10RKsEKvDTz5H-alxkejiM4AwYJ1a4qn7ZGWtHsVVPkA/edit?usp=sharing)

### Approval (Web)
The web interface allows the user to make a final decision on the selection. The 2 step (curate then approve) process is built for porjects with very high volume of content. Advertisers can engage multiple curators to look through more content. The process also reduces human errors.

### Presentation (Web and beyond)
Most projects use HTML as the output format. Currently there are 2 layouts implemented. The code extends from the base/core classes. Please refer to the [Customization](#customization) fordetails.

## Key Benefits
* No Twitter API integration
* No database/backend server required
* Project are isolated to minimize security risks
* Straight forward code implementation

## Technical specifications
CPT uses JavaScript as the main programming language and Firebase for database, user authentication and hosting. There are also some python scripts for development purpose but it is totally optional to use them.

## About Firebase
Firebase is product of Google Cloud Platform. CPT uses Firebase for its the cloud computing services. 

### Firestore
Firestore is a database as service product. Firestore can be accessed using JavaScript in a normal HTML page. Access rights are configured via Firestore's rules. 

### Hosting
Web pages are hosted using Firebase's static site hosting services. It comes with an SSL certificate and a subdomain like \`project-cpt.web.app\`. It also supports custom domain if it is needed. 

### Fees
All projects are created under the free tier. The free tier is generous enough to handle most of the use cases. You can switch to "pay as you go" tier if you foresee heavy usage.

## User Guide
### Setup Firebase 
* Sign up a Firebase account at https://firebase.google.com/
* Create a new project (It takes a few minutes for the project to be fully ready)
* Configure project resource region
  * Google cloud has a few datacenters located at different parts of the world. Use the region closest to your project's location for better server speed.
  * Go to \`Project Settings\` section

    ![Firebase Project Settings](firebase-project-settings.jpg)
  * Set \`Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resource location\`. This cannot be changed once set. Use 'us-central' if unsure which one to choose.

* Configure the authentication methods
  * Click at the Authentication link

    ![Firebase Authentication Link](firebase-authentication-link.jpg)
  * Click at the "Sign-in Method" link and enable Email/Password sign-in method.

### Setup dev environment
* Firebase requires nodejs. Install nodejs if needed.
  * [Download installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) from the office nodejs website  
  * Run the installer
* Install firebase command line tool: \`sudo npm install -g firebase-tools\`
* There are some script files written in Python 3. They are not compulsory.

### Initialize project
* Download/Clone the CPT project
* In terminal, change to \`firebase\` folder of the project
* Run \`firebase login\` and follow the instructions to store the credentials onto your machine. You only need to do this ones. 
* Run \`firebase init\` to initalize the project
  * Activate \`Database\`, \`Firestore\`, \`Functions\`, \`Hosting\` and \`Storage\` features. 

    ![Firebase Features](firebase-features.jpg)

  * Select the project created in Firebase's online console
  * Keep pressing enter to use the default settings

### Local server
* Run \`firebase serve\` to run the local development server
* Alternative, you can use \`python server.py\`
  * The python scripts has livereload built in, which automatically reloads your browser when files are changed
  * However, this requires python 3 and livereload library
  * You need to run \`pip install livereload\` to fulfill the requirements
* To deploy the project, run \`firebase deploy\`

### Adding user accounts 
* A Python script is created for quick add/update user accounts
* Run the script by \`python add_user.py\` to start it
* Key in the email address of the user
* The account will be created with a randomly generated password
* If the email is already in use, the account's password will be replaced by the newly generated one

## Customization

### Tweaking the look and feel
There are 2 sample codes for displaying tweets, \`display-single.html\` and \`display-wall.htm\`. You can view them via local server \`http://localhost:8000/display-single.html\` and \`http://localhost:8000/display-wall.html\`. The corresponding files are in \`public\` folder. It is quite straight forward to customize the CSS portion to change colors, background and sizes etc. If the HTML strucutre is in the way, you have to make changes on the JavaScript level. The easiest way is to make changes on \`base.js\` file and look for \`BaseRenderer\`'s \`render\` function.

### Extending JavaScript
The project is written in vanilla Javascript with ES2015 flavor. It uses \`modules\` to share codes between the admin and display layers. \`base.js\` contains the core code.

There are 3 parts of the app. 
1. ### Renderer

    * Responsible for how to display a single tweet as a DOM element
    * It parses the JSON object saved from twitter.com
    * The renderer uses twemoji library to make sure all emojis are rendered in twitter way
    * To add custom emojis (aka hashflags), pass a dictionary of hashtags and assets file name. e.g. \` { "OneTeam": "OneTeam_V2Design_Evergreen.png" }\`
      * The hashtags are case insensitive. All hashtags will be converted into lower case for easier matching.
      * For unicode based hashtags, please use the unicode characters directly, not the \`\u0000\` convention
    * There are a few functions to customize
      * \`trimText\`: decide which part of the text is meant to be displayed. The full text contains mentions and links/medias at the end. 
      * \`hilightLinks\`: add blue color to hilight links, not clickable 
      * \`highlightHashtags\`: add blue color to hilight hashtags, not clickable
      * \`expendMedia\`: extract the first image/video in the attached medias. It is possible to extract all images however, it is hard to find a good way to show all of them.
      * \`expendVideo\`: extract the video asset URL, called within the \`expendMedia\` function.
      * \`render\`: calls all the necessary functions and make the DOM element. 
      
2. ### Layout Manager

    * Responsible for the arrangement or sequence to show all the tweets, e.g. how to transit from one to another
    * An instance of layout manager is initialized with an instance of a renderer
    * There are a few functions to customize
      * \`addEntry\`: add an entry to the page
      * \`removeEntry\`: remove an entry from the page
      * \`clear\`: reset the display

2. ### App

    * Responsible for database(firestore) related tasks
    * Monitors changes from the database and passes the changes to its layout manager

## TODOs
### Implement media caching
* If a user deletes her/his tweet, the image/video will disappear
* If a user deletes her/his account, the profile image wiil disappear
* Write a Firebase \`Function\` to download these images and save them into \`Storage\`

## HOWTOs
### How to install Unpacked Chrome Extension
Currently the Chrome extension is not submitted to Chrome Store. It is to install via as a "unpacked extension". 
* First Download the zip file from online and extract it into a location
* Go to Chrome's \`settings\` page
* Then click at the \`Extensions\` link on the left hand side
* Turn on the \`develop mode\`
* Choose \`Load unpacked\` option to install the extension

### How to change Firebase's ApiKey
* Unlikely there will be any effect because the solutions requires authentication for \`write\` permissions
* Just in case you need replace the ApiKey, you can do this via [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials)

### How to autoplay video
* Browsers do not allow video autoplay without users interaction
* When using Chrome, click anywhere on the page will activate video auto-play
* Only for safari, you can overwrite such settings by [following this article](https://www.howtogeek.com/326532/safari-now-disables-auto-playing-videos.-heres-how-to-allow-them-for-certain-sites/)`;
